        <p>Step 1</p>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute. Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low, and let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
